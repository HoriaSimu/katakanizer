### What is this?

This is a simple app which will transliterate user's input to *katakana*, a Japanese writing system used primarily for writing foreign words and names.

You can see it in action here:

Main goals in making this app:
* Refreshing my knowledge of JS (and particularily the use of regex)
* Getting a bit of practice with properly setting up a React project
* Learning a bit of Japanese

### What is *katakana*?

*Katakana* is a script whose characters describe every sound in Japanese language:
* vowels *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*
* syllables consisting of a consonant followed by the above mentioned vowels
* the consonant *n*

Read more about *katakana* on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana).
